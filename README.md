# Build-a-Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier-With-The-Help-of-The-LDA-and-PCA-Methods

**Context and objective:** 

Our work will be focused on a numerical dataset which describes wine quality grades that range from 3 to 8 corresponding to 6 distinct classes. The main goal here will be to build a support vector machine classifier to predict the wine grades. We'll be using the principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis methods for dimensionality reduction and compare them to see which one is best suited for our classifier. 

**Note:** This code was written on Jupyter Notebook.  
**Language:** Python.  
**Packages:** numpy, pandas, time, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.
